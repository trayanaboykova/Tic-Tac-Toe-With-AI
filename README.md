# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe with AI (Java)

A console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring **multiple AI difficulty levels** — including an **unbeatable minimax algorithm** at hard mode. Players can battle the computer, watch AI vs AI, or play player vs player with real-time board updates and strict input validation.

Developed as part of my **[JetBrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/)** learning path, this project demonstrates game logic, recursion, decision-making algorithms, and clean console UI design in Java.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project evolves through several stages, introducing increasingly intelligent opponents:

- **User gameplay** — Accepts and validates human input on the grid.
- **Easy AI** — Selects random valid moves.
- **Medium AI** — Blocks immediate threats and takes instant wins when possible.
- **Hard AI** — Uses the minimax algorithm to evaluate the full game tree and always plays perfectly.
- **Game State Logic** — Handles win conditions, draws, and unfinished games reliably.
- **Command System** — Start user vs AI, AI vs AI, or exit anytime.

## 🎯 What I Learned

- 🧠 **Game Algorithms:** Implementing strategies from simple heuristics to perfect minimax logic.
- 🔄 **Recursion & Backtracking:** Exploring game trees and evaluating optimal moves.
- 🧩 **Clean Code Structure:** Separating game logic, rendering, validation, and AI behaviors.
- 🎤 **Robust Input Handling:** Preventing invalid moves and maintaining smooth user interaction.
